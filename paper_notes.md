# Things we should do

Plot survey demographics (histogram or something).

[not related to anything I read, but ICA would be a good alternative to PCA/MCA]



# Appreciating the variety of goals in computational neuroscience

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03211v1.pdf

Organization: What are the goals of the paper (to learn about modeling in computational neuroscience)? A short list of modeling goals. Survey demographics. Methods were to ask participants to choose up to 3 papers they co-authored. 

Then result: plot median results (and bootstrapped error bars) of modeling goals in the comp neuro community, using the 'short list of goals' described above.

Next did PCA on the goals and showed the loadings across components. Then reconstruct data using only the first three components and show the cross-correlation matrix, first unordered then re-ordered to show block structure, then with grey outlines to show putative 'groups of dimensions' in the data (I think these are essentially hand-drawn.)

Then final figure is plotting the loadings, first weight on PC1 vs PC2, then PC1 vs PC3. Insets show raw answers from the authors of the manuscript.

Finally, some discussion, etc.

Take-away: Do PCA and find block structure, emphasize diversity of responses. Discussion was several key points that they wanted to point out.


# What is behavior? And so what? 

http://www.sdp.org/publications/papers/WhatIsBehavior.pdf

Starts with a description of some definitions of behavior. Then says that this paper addresses two phenomena: what is 'behavior'? And what does it matter that we come up with a definition of behavior? Then says that there are three sections: (1) a conceptual formulation of behavior, (2) discussing this formulation and addressing objections, and (3) relating why having such a formulation is important.

They have some weird definition that requires eight parameters: Identity, Want, Know, Know-How, Performance, Achievement, Personal Characteristics, and Significance.

Maybe read this in more detail at some point, so we can add to the discussion


# Understanding behavior to understand behavior change: a literature review

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13504620802148881

Talks about behaviorism. Then discusses hierarchy of behaviors. Affective and cognitive interplay in behavior.


# Behavior, Purpose and Teleology

https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1086/286788

Discussion by Norbert Wiener et al. Want to define behavioristic study of events and classify behavior. This is especially worth thinking about for discussion/etc

# Behavioural biologists don't agree on what constitutes behaviour

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760923/

Big takeaway from this: "No one agrees on what behavior is" is really catchy. The main inspiration for our survey.

"Respondents contradict themselves, each other, and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour.' We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: â€œBehaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes."

Talk about Tinbergen's Four Questions.

Goes through four things needed for a scientific definition (operational, essential, widely applicable, and succinct). Went through the behavioral biology literature and found 25 operationally distinct definitions of behavior. List seven of them here. Make a chart for each questino as to whether it constitutes behavior under a certain definition.

# THE MOLAR VIEW OF BEHAVIOR AND ITS USEFULNESS IN BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS

https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-44018-010.pdf

Molar vs molecular behavior.

Molecular: small discrete units. 

Molar: Long-run, contextual.

Example is coin-flipping: A coin turning up heads is a molecular behavior, the overall probability is the molar behavior.
